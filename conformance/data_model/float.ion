TESTING NOTES:

It is assumed that floats are largely handled by a standard library with reliable test covereage.
Do not use this test suite as the only standard for any home-spun floating point number implementation.

In IEEE 754 interchange formats, binary format NaNs are represented with the exponential field filled with ones (like
infinity values), and ANY non-zero number in the significand field. These test cases use the quiet and signalling NaN
encodings as specified in IEEE-754-2019, although there areother legal representations of NaN.
