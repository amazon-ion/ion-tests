// Test Cases:
// set_symbols can be invoked by name, address, qualified address, qualified name, binary address, and binary system e-expression op code.
// the argument values may be zero or more non-null text values
// set_symbols does not have any side-effects on the macro table
// set_symbols replaces the current symbol table with a new symbol table that consists of the arguments of set_symbols
// annotations on any argument value should signal an error (because it's not allowed in the symbol table rather than because of any specific validation by the set_symbols macro)
